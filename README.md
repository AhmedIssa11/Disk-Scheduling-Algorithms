# Disk-Scheduling-Algorithms

The algorithms used for disk scheduling are called as disk scheduling algorithms.
The purpose of disk scheduling algorithms is to reduce the total seek time.

### Implementation of the following Disk Algorithms:
- FCFS First Come First Serve
- SSTF Shortest Seek Time First
- SCAN Elevator Algorithm.
- CSCAN Circular-SCAN
- LOOK  improved version of the SCAN Algorithm
- CLOOK Circular-LOOK
